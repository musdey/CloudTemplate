# Guestlist

## What is Guestlist?

In the pandemic situation many governments forced restaurants, barbershops etc. to keep track of their customers in order to detect possible infected persons and inform them. Guestlist is a open-source solution to this problem and keeps the focus on usability for both guests and shop-owners. The idea is to allow anyone to deploy this repo on a server running docker easily by only setting the configs inside the env file.
